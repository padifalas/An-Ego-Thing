# An-Ego-Thing


**An Ego Thing** is a fun, simple 2D game where the player character's head grows as they gain momentum, making movement a bit wobbly and unpredictable. The game features playful mechanics, where exaggerated movement and floating jumps create unique challenges for players to navigate.

## **Game Features:**

- **Momentum-Based Movement:** The more you run, the harder it is to stop. Momentum causes you to overcommit to your direction.
- **Bouncy Jumps:** When jumping, the player character's jump feels floaty and wobbly, adding to the challenge.
- **Head Growth Mechanic:** As the player gains speed, their head grows slightly, representing their increased overconfidence and adding a visual effect.
- **Simple Goal:** Navigate through platforming sections while managing momentum and dealing with the head growth mechanic.

## **How to Play:**

1. **Move Left/Right:** Use the arrow keys or "A" and "D" to move.
2. **Jump:** Press the "Space" bar to jump (only if grounded).
3. **Objective:** Reach the goal while managing your character's growing head and momentum.

## **How It Works:**

- The character's head grows based on the current speed (momentum). The speed directly affects the scale of the characterâ€™s head.
- The character's movement and jump behaviors are modified to create a playful, exaggerated effect.
